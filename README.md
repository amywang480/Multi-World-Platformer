# Multi-World-Platformer
A multi-world platformer game, called the Treasure of Time, created in C# using MonoGame within Visual Studio. The game involves collecting required numbers of objects in various worlds as the player moves across platforms while avoiding obstacles and purchasing power-ups with the coins collected within the worlds. The game was originally created for a final computer science ISU (Independent Study Unit) project.

The following GIF shows the one of the worlds in the game, the Fall World. The GIF shows the various pathways the player can take within a world while demonstrating how a player loses control of their movement keys upon hitting a snake or chain (the obstacles) and how passing through doors transports the player to the next world.
